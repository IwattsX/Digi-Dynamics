With the help of rare serum, your team members can avoid crystallization, but their virus will still have many adverse effects on them, including the decline of viability and the acceleration of mental collapse. This kind of serum is extremely rare and the supply is tight. How to maximize its effectiveness needs your careful consideration.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Supplies</h2>Supplies are the primary way to restore health to your party members outside of combat. The amount of supplies that your team can carry is limited when  set off, but you will find some supply boxes while exploring . In addition, you can also find scattered supplies in the ruins.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">SAN\u503c</h2>The SAN(Sanity)  value represents the mental state of your squad. Serious injuries in battle, certain choices in the exploration, every decision in the mapping domain may make the mental state of the team members worse. As a result, the combat ability of the team members will be reduced, and they may even act in violation of your orders. You can use medicine to temporarily maintain the mental state of the team members, or use superb command tactics to restore the team's confidence.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Strategy Card</h2>During the exploration, your team will encounter various crises. Using strategy cards to temporarily adjust strategies can help the team survive a crisis, but there is often a price to pay. Since each strategy card can only be used once in an exploration, the timing of its use is particularly important.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Battle</h2>There are rich combat mechanisms in &quot;Broken Preimage&quot;. For example, you can use the &quot;knockback&quot; skill to cause two units to collide and stun them; or kill the target before it can act by &quot;summoned monitor&quot; . But you must pay attention to that many skill could make friendly damage. To avoid injuring your own troops, you need to always pay attention to the position of each team member.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Tasks and Events</h2>In exploration, you may encounter events that need to be dealt with or civilians who ask for help. Focusing on them will cause more trouble, and rewards simultaneously. By collection of the information in those events\uff0cthere is often hidden clue which lead you to discover the truth of the world.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2337470/extras/brokenpreimage_paragraph600w02_schinese.png?t=1683440541\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Extra Battle Mode</h2>In subsequent versions, we will add another battle mode. In which, you can try to persuade some enemies instead of fighting. But if the persuasion fails, it is possible to enrage the enemy and make them stronger.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Chapters</h2>We have planned a total of five chapters of light rogue exploration zones, each chapter will have a unique special design, as well as a wealth of tasks and events. In addition, there are seven well-designed, refreshing RPG-oriented plot levels will also arrive as scheduled.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Characters</h2>In the next version, we will open the recruitment station system and add more available combat characters. Each new character has an independent personality and a distinctive fighting style, and is equipped with exquisite standing paintings. We will add the permanent death system of characters as appropriate according to the feedback obtained from the early  version.",
