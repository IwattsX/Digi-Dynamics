    "about_the_game": "Fusillade is an action rogue-like space shoot 'em up, where you play cards and combos in real-time to fight off pirates. At the end of each wave you choose between 100+ cards to add to your deck! Like heat-seeking torpedoes, targeted missiles, laser cannons, and more! Put your deck building skills to the test and craft the best combinations of cards. Never ending missiles, one shot Lazer, and screen-wide lighting are just some of the builds you can create. Can you withstand the galactic pressure?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nReal Time Card Game: Play cards in real-time and experience the rich strategic depth of table top cards games in seconds as the fast pace action flys by. Playing cards puts you into Bullet Time, giving you time to think and line up your shots. Then it zooms back into the action to fly your ship around and dodge the onslaught of bullets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRouge-Like: Experience the older style of Rouge-Likes, where death is the end. You have no universal upgrades making your skill the most important factor. You will get back up and dive in for one more round.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSky-High Difficulty Scaling: Choose between 30 different difficulty levels to match your skills. You can enjoy the stars if you're a novice, or you can challenge your crazy side, and get obliterated by the cosmos in a true bullet hell!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCampaign Mode: You can fight through 40 curated waves with pre-planned bosses and enemies. Complete quests along your journey into the unknown, gaining unique items, cards and upgrades. Then find the secret living at the heart of the galaxy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEndless Mode: How long can you last in a never ending onslaught of pirates? Reach for the stars to get the highest score possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFusillade was developed by  a 1 man developer Ethan Oaks, who made all the art, sound, music, and code as a passion project.",
