The game explores themes of mortality and fear, creating an immersive and suspenseful experience. Player discretion is advised, especially for individuals sensitive to themes of death and horror. We have aimed to craft these elements with care and respect for the player experience, but the game's content is designed to elicit fear and suspense, enhancing the overall atmosphere of the gameplay."
