Some are even attempting to fly, so they can meet the Bird Gods in the sky, but it rarely ends well.<br><br><strong>Y\u0103dakk \u00dcrkaz</strong><br>The \u00dcrkaz from the Khalee Highlands are known as a gruff and unfriendly group that controls the Y\u0103dakk's criminal underground. Smuggling, racketeering, and other shady dealings are all steps to their goal of economic domination of the Square! <br><br>Tribe skins are basically costumes for the tribe that will change an entire tribe's aesthetic from the ground up! New clothes, new buildings, new music, and sometimes even new animals! The Skins are also visible in multiplayer mode and the AI opponents will also use the skins.<br><br>* Note that Tribe Skins are not actual gameplay changes, such as adding new units or abilities to the tribes. The skinned versions of tribes play the exact same way as their default skins.",
