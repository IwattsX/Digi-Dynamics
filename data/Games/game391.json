Monster taming games are some of my favorite video games and I am excited to be making one of my own. I feel that an underutilized aspect of these games is the relationship that the tamer has with the monster. For this reason, I would like for this game to be primarily a virtual pet experience built into an RPG. If this concept sounds appealing to you, please stick around for this journey. Please feel free to make suggestions and comments as I greatly value feedback. <br><br>I hope that you will enjoy your experience in the DreaMon World.<br><br>Thanks<br><br>- Courier Games",
