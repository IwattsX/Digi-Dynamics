        "notes": "This game contains some parts that can be considered as violent, such as npc's using weapons and magic against each other, using magic to destroy some game objects such as wooden doors. This part of game is made with regards to plot and doesn't concentrate on violence itself. It is more an indie strategy game with magic items crafting system."
