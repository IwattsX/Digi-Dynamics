A homage to the rugged people who live and breathe the most challenging and exciting farming lifestyle in the world: Being an NT Pastoralist. Pasture allows gamers from all over the world to experience the highs and lows of being a pastoralist, doing battle with the weather, the markets, and mother nature herself to come out on top as they build their cattle empire. Make no mistake, without the vigilant stewardship of your property, your herd will escape, be predated upon, or perish. Clever management can cause your herd to flourish, your infrastructure to be sound, and your bank account to blossom. This sim lets nature take course whether you are watching it or not.
