It's success lead to a further 15 V class locomotives to be built by the Phoenix Foundry in Ballarat, remaining in service from 1900 till 1930. Originally built as Vauclain Compound locomotives, which used the steam twice to propel the locomotive before exhausting out the chimney, the class was reboilered and converted to Simple Expansion locomotives in 1912-13. Later, from 1923, the lass was renumbered between 200 and V215 (several locos were scrapped prior to renumbering). The first to be scrapped was V513 in June 1924, with V499 (now V200) being the last in 1930.<br><br>V499, being the pattern loco, arrived and ran with several differences from the rest of the class. The most prominent was the Baldwin builders plates mounted on the smokeboxes sides and smokebox door; the smokebox door plate being removed when converted to feature the more typical 'dart' arrangement on Victorian Railways locomotives, along with several other changes early in life. It's tender also featured rolled disc wheels, and a 'straight' flare at the top that was typical of Baldwin locomotives. When first introduced to service V499 wore Baldwin Green with gold lining, polished steelwork and brasswork, Russian Iron boiler, and Mineral Brown running boards, roof, and tender top.
