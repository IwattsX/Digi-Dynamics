I'm a veteran tap rhythm player. I've been playing for over 10 years mostly every tap rhythm game and excelled at every one of them. This game is beyond difficult and is the ONLY game that can give me a good bit of frustration AND sweaty palms. 5 stars for this game and the developers for making an extremely challenging and yet beautiful game. It feels like I have went back in time and started rhythm all over again. Don't get this game if you have a bad temper.\u201d<br />\r\n5/5 \u2013 Hunter Cooper<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cI never leave reviews, but this one really is deserved. Hidden gem\u2014came across this app from the ADOFAI collab but this really is an excellent game in its own right. Challenging, but the great music and satisfying gameplay kept me hooked until the end. Will definitely be keeping an eye out for this developer in the future!\u201d<br />\r\n5/5 \u2013 H B<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\u201cAwesome and creative game. I'm a long time fan of rhythm games and it's cool to see a concept like this on mobile. The music is very good as well! I like how the beats are split between kick and snare, playing the game teaches you drum beats in a way!\u201d<br />\r\n5/5 \u2013 Josephine<br />\r\n", "header_image":
