This pack consists of the following Shadow of the Demon Lord products: <br>  <br> <br> <strong> Curse the Light</strong> <br> <br> The ancient enemies of the genies, foes of the faeries, and masters of dark and terrible magic, trolls changed the course of history through their efforts to triumph over their enemies, but paid the ultimate price for their success. Now a people driven into the darkness, shunned and hated, they raise their fists to the sun and hatch diabolical plots in the depths. Curse the Lightreveals new details about the trolls and their loathsome kind. With this new Monstrous Pages supplement, you can make these figures a truly terrible threat in your adventures and campaigns! <br>  <br> <br> <strong> Forces of Nature</strong> <br> <br> Unthinking and uncaring, giants are more forces of nature than villains. Birthed long ago in the time of the Troll King, the consensus among the learned is that giants were enslaved, bred, created, or otherwise spawned to serve as war machines during the Troll Wars. Untouched by the degradations of their former masters, they trudge on, indulging in their base desires. <br> This installment of Monstrous Pages, Forces of Nature, examines giants in all their menace. From their uncertain origins to an overview of their strange beliefs and behaviors, in these pages you will find everything you need to let loose these brutes to stomp across your campaign. This entry also expands on giants by providing customization options and abhorrent new breeds. Read on and create nasty, brutish, and gigantic encounters your players will soon not forget. <br>  <br> <br> <strong> Foulest Reptiles</strong> <br> <br> Foulest Reptiles reveals the secrets of the lizardmen, a degenerate race of reptilian humanoids that live on the edges of settled lands, and lays bare the true origins of these cruel and vicious people. Like other installments of the Monstrous Pages series, this supplement offers extensive lore about the creatures and expands on their abilities, providing you with even more customization options and variants. In addition, Foulest Reptiles also gives you rules for making unique lizardmen characters. Whether you intend to feature lizardmen as the principle villains in your adventure or you want to learn more about the world of Urth, this supplement is loaded with information for your Shadow of the Demon Lord games. <br>  <br> <br> <strong> Ghastly Gourmands</strong> <br> <br> Many perils await the travelers who venture beyond the villages and towns speckling the countryside. Among the greatest and most dangerous of these are ogres. Great, lumbering brutes driven by a need to gorge themselves on living flesh and warm blood, they constantly roam, seeking to stuff their gigantic maws with any creature too slow to escape their huge grasping hands or the deadly swing of their giant spiked clubs. Gobbling down their prey, they pay little heed to whatever fur, fleece, filth, clothing, armor, or weapons their struggling victims may have. They ceaselessly want--need--only to eat. And when they have swallowed the last of their meal, they let loose a thunderous belch and move on to find another victim to devour. <br> In this installment of Monstrous Pages, Ghastly Gourmands examines ogres and all their awful kin. From their horrid origins to an overview of their usual haunts, you will find everything you need in these pages to make ogres a truly terrifying threat in your games. In addition, this entry also expands on ogres by providing customization options and new breeds of these gluttonous people. Read on to learn everything you never wanted to know about ogres! <br>  <br> <br> <strong> Wretched and Unclean</strong> <br> <br> They come in the night, the wretched and unclean, an unholy mob intent on murder and plunder. Their white bodies, eyes dark with hate, appear human, but they surrendered their humanity long ago and now are little more than monsters. The troglodytes steal supplies, carry off victims, and butcher everything they leave behind, smearing their bodies with the blood of their kill and lifting their voices into hooting cries to mock the wails of those they make suffer. Time and again, the peoples of the world above have tried to dig out these subterranean dwellers, but no expedition, no matter how well funded or supplied, has ever managed to clear them all away. The troglodytes always return. <br> Wretched and Unclean examines the lost and inbred descendants of the Men of Gog, called troglodytes by the people they harm. Inside these pages, you'll find the secrets of this lost race of mankind, their motivations and their habits, along with a bevvy of new variations to bring them to the forefront of your campaigns! <br>  <br> Combat encounter maps included: None <br>  <br> This pack features the following: <br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Over 40 NPC entries, included such iconoclastic monsters as the horned ogre, oni, and serpent of the witch-king</li><li>NPCs range from Difficulty 10 to 1,000</li><li>Three ancestries for creating monstrous PCs</li><li>Detailed explanations of the historical background and the chracteristics of the monsters</li></ul>   &quot;",
