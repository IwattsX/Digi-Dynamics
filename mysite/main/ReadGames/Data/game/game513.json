    "about_the_game": "<strong>Parabellum: Artifacts of War</strong> is a Single-Player First Person Shooter/Melee Combat game where you play as Dean Edwards, a museum curator who researches and explores historic battlefields. When you encounter an artifact, you will find yourself transported into the battle. There you will fight as a soldier who would have used the artifact and, in time, that artifact will be added to your museum's exhibits. Relive the exhilarating and terrifying military moments of human history, from the Roman legions sieging Carthage in the 3rd Punic War to the U.S. Army's involvement in the Iraq War and many battles in-between!",
