    "about_the_game": "You've just stepped out of an erratic elevator into the eerily silent reception of a hotel floor that shouldn't exist. The neon lights flicker, casting long, ominous shadows, and the d\u00e9cor screams 1980s \u2013 an atmosphere frozen in time, filled with an unsettling nostalgia. Welcome to the 13th Floor, a place where time is malleable and dimensions converge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNavigating the winding corridors and countless rooms, you're faced with a series of intense challenges. Although most rooms are empty, echoing with the ghostly remnants of a forgotten era, a few still harbor lost souls. Some might be trapped just like you, while others could pose a threat to your very existence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach time you dare to enter, the 13th Floor presents a different layout, seemingly randomly generated to keep you on your toes. While the environment remains constant in your current playthrough, no two attempts are the same. Time is fractured here. One moment you could be facing a static-filled TV broadcasting a plea for help from 1985, and the next, you\u2019re witnessing a future event that sends chills down your spine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe underlying mystery of the 13th Floor slowly unravels with every room you enter. Who built this floor? Why is it hidden between dimensions? And how do you escape a place that defies the very fabric of reality?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour sanity, wit, and determination are the only things that will get you out of this liminal space. Can you navigate the warped corridors of time and dimension to find the elusive exit? Or will you become yet another permanent guest on the 13th Floor?",
