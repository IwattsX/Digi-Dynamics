The environment is partly hand tailored and partially randomly generated, and it changes whenever the player dies, so you'll never know what to expect.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Story</h2>When God Left Us is a nightmarish tale of a world abandoned by its creator, where the Church has split into two factions and the people can no longer die. The Church of Hate's obsession with power and immortality leads to a ritual of severing tongues to prevent them from conjuring portals to escape.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2371160/extras/marking-steam.gif?t=1681246908\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">The Tears Of God</h2>When God abandoned the world, an eternal darkness engulfed everything, a shroud that only the Tears of God could pierce. These crystallized tears are the sole light source of this desolate and forsaken world. You'll be able to collect these light sources and carry them with you to illuminate the darkness. You can use them to mark your path and avoid getting lost. You will also be able to throw them around causing them to release a series of flashes and loud shrieks, illuminating their surroundings and allowing you to determine what lies ahead. Beware though, as you will likely attract unwanted attention.<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2371160/extras/taking-tear-steam.gif?t=1681246908\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Death</h2>Permanent death is not part of the world since God abandoned it. When you die in the game, your body will eventually heal itself, and you'll awaken somewhere else, where your assailant left you. However, don't be fooled into thinking that you'll come out of each death unscathed. Each time you die, there will be consequences that will impact your ability to navigate the environment and avoid danger. You may suffer from a limp or other physical condition that will make it more difficult to survive the horrors that lurk in the darkness.",
