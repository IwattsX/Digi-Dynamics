    "about_the_game": "Radioactive is a turn based strategy game of nuclear war. The idea is simple: pick a Missile Silo, set the angle and range to your target and click Fire. Missiles will creep across the map of the world to destroy the enemy, so the game is a mix of turn-based and real-time play. An ideal game for several people, up to four players can take it turns to play.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis demo is a non-playable showcase of a game played by four computer opponents. It is designed for you to test the game engine on your PC to make sure it works, and to watch a game being played.",
