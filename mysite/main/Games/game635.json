    "about_the_game": "Keita, a brave emperor penguin, lost its way during the migration and would start an extraordinary adventure on the ice alone.<br />\r\nThe blue sky, snow-white ground, enlargeable snowballs, interesting levels, unexpected endings and various level clearance methods will all get you immersed. Just control Keita to start your journey.<br />\r\n1. Tired of noisy and polluted environment, you will find long-lost freshness and tranquility in the game.<br />\r\n2. You will pass the level with an enlargeable snowball. The size of the snowball is adjustable, and so is the way to pass the level, which will get you a long-lost satisfaction.<br />\r\n3. The game level is designed full of mystery, and the following levels are difficult to pass in a single shot, so you need to keep trying.<br />\r\n4. After clearing the level, you will deeply feel the greatness in such an otherwise small game.<br />\r\n5. The game is educationally meaningful, and it\u2019s also suitable for children.",
