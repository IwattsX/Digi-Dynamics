    "about_the_game": "Keali is a puzzle-platformer that encourages discovery and experimentation. The game is linear with story elements and hidden lore elements. There are several timing, reaction and problem solving elements within the game. The demo's difficulty increases faster than the main game to show some later game components. For constancy the story has been trimmed from the Demo.",
